## Author:

## Contributors:

## Features:
* Synchronize your files with 0 setup. Works with SFTP. Requires public key authentication.
* Live file monitoring. Syndir by default runs in foreground as blocking application, watching directories recursively. On each file change it will automatically upload changed file to remote host in destination folder.
* Any amount of remote hosts supported. Just give them as additional params.
* Automatic creation of remote non existent remote directories.
* Full support for File & Directory creation/ deletion.
* Asynchronous, parallel transfers for multiple hosts at once.
* Uses almost no memory (< 5MiB RSS for 64bit app, even when syncing huge files)
* Provided auto screenshot upload tool called Synshot. It's built automatically on OSX.


## Requirements:
* [Qt4 4.8.x](http://qt-project.org/downloads) (only QtCore part of framework)
* [LibSSH2 1.4.x](http://www.libssh2.org)


## Preffered/Optional requirements.:
* [Sofin 0.46.x](http://verknowsys.github.com/sofin/) - Because it has predefined "qt" (with minimal build of Qt4 for servers) and "libssh2" definitions. Sofin is used by default in Syndir's installation script: [make_all.sh](https://github.com/VerKnowSys/Syndir/blob/master/make_all.sh).


## Building:
```sh
./make_all.sh # it will by default use sofin to install all dependencies and build Syndir project
```


## Examples:
```sh
syndir /Volumes/Projects/MyProjectDir myhost.com:/existing/destination/MyProjectDir
```
or
```sh
syndir /Volumes/Projects/MyProjectDir dmilith@myhost.com:/existing/destination/MyProjectDir
```
or
```sh
syndir /Volumes/Projects/MyProjectDir dmilith@myhost.com:/existing/destination/MyProjectDir more.hosts:/somewhere and.even.more:/copies/myproject (...)
```
Will launch Syndir in watch mode, automatically uploading each modified file from MyProjectDir(s) to destination MyProjectDir. It works recursively thoughout directory structure for each given remote location.


## TODO:
* Gracefully handle "too many open files" error on deep/big source directories.
